## Method

### **1. Roast the Aubergine and Courgette**

1. Preheat the oven to **220°C**.

2. Toss the **aubergine** and **courgette** with olive oil and salt.

3. Spread on a tray and roast for **20–25 minutes** until browned and lightly caramelised.

4. Set aside.

*(This prevents sogginess and builds real flavour.)*

---

### **2. Build a Deep Flavour Base**

5. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat with a generous amount of olive oil.

6. Add the **onions** and **carrots**, season with salt, and cook for **10–15 minutes**, allowing them to brown rather than just soften.

7. Add the **garlic**, **oregano**, **thyme**, **ground coriander**, and **smoked paprika**. Stir for **60–90 seconds** until fragrant.

8. Add the **tomato paste**, cook for 1 minute to caramelise it slightly.

---

### **3. Develop the Sauce**

9. Pour in the **tinned tomatoes** and stir to combine.

10. Add the **stock**, bring to a gentle simmer.

---

### **4. Cook the Lentils**

11. Once the pot is simmering, add the **lentils** and **tinned beans**.

12. Add **MSG** if using.

13. Reduce to low heat and cook for **35–45 minutes**, stirring occasionally.

14. Add more water or stock if the stew thickens too quickly.

15. Season throughout, tasting regularly.

*(Lentils cook more reliably when added once the pot is already simmering.)*

---

### **5. Finish the Dish**

16. Fold the **roasted aubergine and courgette** into the pot.

17. Cook for another **5–10 minutes** to meld flavours.

18. Add **red wine vinegar or lemon juice** to brighten the dish.

19. Adjust seasoning one final time.

---

### **Service**

20. Serve in deep bowls.

21. Finish with **fresh basil or parsley**, toasted seeds, or a drizzle of olive oil for contrast.

---

## Notes

- Lentils can vary; cook to tenderness rather than time. Add extra water if needed.  
- Use lemon juice sparingly; the goal is brightness, not acidity.  
- A spoonful of harissa can be added for heat and depth.  
- This reheats exceptionally well and tastes even better on day two.
