(5.0⭐️)

This ramen is a solid choice which can easily be used as a base to mix and match with different veg etc. It can be a bit overwhelming on first attempt, just make sure everything is prepped before you cook.

## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Chop the **chicken breast** in half with a butterfly cut, season with **olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper** in a bowl and set aside.

2. Prepare all vegetables and set aside:
    - mince the **ginger** and **garlic** together.
    - quarter the **chestnut mushrooms** and store in a bowl with the whole **shitake mushrooms**.
    - slice the spring onions and chop the parsley and leave aside for garnish.

3. Preheat all the cooking equipment:
    - Eggs: start boiling a pot of water.
    - Chicken: start preheating a frying pan/griddle on medium heat.
    - Stock: stock pot on medium heat.

4. Prepare a bowl of ice water to stop the eggs from cooking.

### **Cooking**

5. In a stock pot, mix the **vegetable oil**, **sesame oil**, **soy sauce**, **mirin**, **garlic**, and **ginger**, cooking on a medium heat until the root vegetables soften.

6. Add the full **chicken stock** to the pot and bring to a simmer.

7. Once the stock is in, start frying the butterflied **chicken** on high heat, turning when the bottom side has browned. 
    - As soon as the chicken is cooked, remove at any time and rest on a chopping board

8. Once the stock has been brought to a simmer, add both of the **mushrooms** and bring to a rolling boil.

9. Once the stock is boiling, add the **eggs** to the boiling pot of water and cook for 7 minutes (for a harder yolk, 8 minutes).

10. 4 minutes prior to the eggs finishing, add the ramen noodles.

11. Once the time is up on the eggs:
    - Immediately remove the eggs and cool them in the ice water.
    - Remove the stock pot from heat.

### **Service**

12. Distribute the ramen and broth evenly between two bowls.

13. Cut the chicken sideways in slices and set on top of the noodles.

14. Once cool to touch, peel the shells from the eggs and slice in half, setting alongside the chicken in the bowls.

15. Garnish with the parsley and spring onions with a splash of soy sauce.

## Notes

> Preparation is key on this, make sure everything is prepped before attempting to cook as you'll be focusing on the cooking process once started.

> As soon as the thickest part of the chicken hits 73°C, remove from heat and rest.
