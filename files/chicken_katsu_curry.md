The actual way to make chicken katsu curry without any of that bs about having to strain the sauce from all the veg. What is that actually about? You waste so much sauce and fibre by not blending it altogether. Moreover, the fibre from the carrots and onions add a much nicer and whole thickness to the final product. Alright, well, I'll stop going on about that. Here is a recipe for chicken katsu curry or something.

## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Slice each **chicken breast** in half lengthways to make four fillets. Place between baking parchment and beat with a rolling pin until an even thickness.

2. Pour the **milk** into a bowl, season generously with salt, add the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours.

3. Set up three bowls:
    - **Flour**, seasoned with shichimi togarashi.
    - **Eggs**, beaten with a splash of soy sauce.
    - **Breadcrumbs**.

4. Remove each chicken fillet from the milk, coat in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Set aside on a plate.
    - At this stage, the chicken can be refrigerated for 24 hours or frozen for up to one month.

### **Curry Sauce**

5. Melt the **butter** in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the **carrot** and **onion** and cook for 5 minutes until softened.

6. Add the **garlic** and **ginger** and cook for a further 2–3 minutes.

7. Stir in the **curry powder** and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

8. Add the **honey**, **ketchup**, **miso paste**, and **soy sauce**, stirring to form a thick paste.

9. Pour in the **boiling water** and crumble in the **stock cube**. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes until the carrot is fully soft.

10. Blend until completely smooth using a blender or hand blender. Season to taste.
    - The sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 3 months.

### **Cooking the Katsu**

11. Heat a generous layer of **sunflower oil** in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.

12. Fry the chicken in batches for 3–4 minutes per side until deep golden and crisp.

13. Transfer cooked fillets to a tray and keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining pieces.

### **Service**

14. Mix the **shredded cabbage** with **nori** and sprinkle with **sesame seeds**, if using.

15. Slice the chicken, spoon over the hot curry sauce, and serve with **rice** and the cabbage salad.

## Notes

> Do not rush the sauce. The depth comes from fully softening the vegetables before blending.

> Oil temperature matters. If it is too cool, the coating will absorb oil; too hot and it will brown before cooking through.

> This reheats exceptionally well. If anything, the curry improves overnight.
