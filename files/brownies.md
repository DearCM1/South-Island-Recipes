## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Preheat fan oven to 160°C.

2. Break up the **dark chocolate** into cubes and add to a bowl with the **butter**. Melt in a microwave at 30 second intervals. Once melted, mix together with a level teaspoon of **fine sea salt** and leave aside to cool.

3. Whisk the **eggs** and **sugar** in a kitchen aid (**see notes**) for 5 minutes on the highest power, until the mix leaves a trail on the surface when dropped from the whisk.

4. Combine the whisked mix with the room temperature chocolate/butter mix, adding a **pinch of salt**. Gently fold the two together until homogeneous, so the air remains in.

5. Sieve together the **flour** and **cocoa powder**, then resift over the brownie mix so that the top is evenly covered. Gently fold together again until fudgy.

6. Mix in the **milk chocolate** (broken into pieces) until evenly distributed.

7. Pour mix into a 20x20cm baking tin lined with non-stick baking paper.

### **Cooking**

8. Cook in oven for 50 minutes, rotating the tin 180° halfway through to ensure even heat distribution.

9. After the elapsed time, poke the centre of the brownie with a probe to see if any mix sticks to the probe (**see notes**). If so, place back in the oven and retest.

10. Cool in the tin for 2 hours then cover the tin with foil and leave over night, cutting the brownies into 9 equal squares the next day.

### **Service**

11. Serve with a dusting of icing sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

## Notes

> Step 3: If you don't have a kitchen aid, hand-whisk until the eggs and sugar double in size and the whisk leaves a trail when dripping.

> Step 9: If you have a thermometer, aim to have the middle of the brownie between the range of 80-90°C
