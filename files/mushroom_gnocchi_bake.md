### **Service**

## Notes

> 1. Get your hands on the [Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup](https://www.geowatkins.com/products/geo-watkins-mushroom-ketchup-190ml) to completely blast this dish to space. You can find it at most major supermarkets.
> 2. The **gnocchi** will cook with the excess water in the dish whilst in the oven. By not pre-boiling the **gnocchi** all the starch remains in the dish, helping thicken the sauce and create a better bite (no sludge).
