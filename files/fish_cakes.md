## Method

### **Filling Preparation (20 mins)**

1. Skin the **fish** and lay in a frying pan with the **bay leaves**, 150ml of **milk**, and 150ml of water.

2. Cover, quickly bring pan to the boil, and lower heat to simmer for 4 minutes.

3. At 4 minutes, take pan off heat and leave on the cover for 10 minutes, so that the **fish** cooks gently.

4. Peel and chop the **potatoes** into 2cm chunks. Whilst the **fish** cook, boil the **potatoes** in salted water for 10 minutes until tender, but not broken.

5. Remove **fish** from pan and allow to cool. Drain the **potatoes** in a colander, allow to drain.

6. Place the **potatoes** back in the pan and dry on low heat for one minute, mashing with a fork, until you have light, dry, fluffy mash.

7. Take the **potatoes** off the heat and mix 1 heaped tablespoon of **tartare sauce**, **lemon zest**, **parsley**, and **chives**. Season to taste.

8. Drain, dry, and season the **fish**. Flake into chunks. Carefully turn the chunks with the potatoes.

### **Cake Preparation (40 mins)**

9. Beat the **egg** in a bowl. Separately, place the **breadcrumbs** in a bowl.

10. Split the filling mix into four and form 1 inch deep cakes.

11. Sit the cakes in the egg bowl, coating the top with a brush.

12. Sit the cakes in the breadcrumb bowl, coating the top and sides with breadcrumbs.

13. Cover and chill the cakes for 30 minutes. (or up to a day ahead).

### **Cooking (20 mins)**

14. In a pan, heat a shallow pool of **vegetable oil** to 190°C. Fry the fish cakes for 5 minutes either side, or until golden.

### **Service**

15. Serve with a wedge of lemon.
