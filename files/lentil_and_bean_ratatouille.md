# Lentil and Bean Ratatouille 🐭

---
A vegetable and legume ratatouille-style stew built for max-style flavour which reheats exceptionally well and tastes even better on day two.

**IMPORTANT:** When cooking this dish, it is important to know that **salt** is your friend and **water** is your enemy:

- **Salt:** Make sure to salt at every stage and continually taste. The lentils do a great job of absorbing a lot of the salt, therefore the end product runs a risk of tasting very bland. This dish requires an obscene amount of salt.
- **Water:** Before adding any of the wet product to the pan (stock and tinned tomatoes), you want to cook off as much water from the vegetable mirepoix as possible. This stops the dish from having a stodgy texture. Additionally, by roasting the courgette/aubergine and browning the mirepoix, the flavour is much richer too.

>*This is version 2, which improves on proper browning, roasted vegetables, toasted spices, and an bright, acidic finish to balance the richness.*

## Method

### **1. Roast the aubergine and courgette**

1. Dice the **aubergine** and **courgettes** (removing the courgette cores) into small cubes and toss them in a bowl with **olive oil** and **salt**.
2. Air fry at 180 °C for 20–30 minutes, tossing every 5 minutes, until the volume of the vegetables have reduced considerably and the edges of the **aubergines** have blackened<sup> Note 1</sup>.
3. Set aside.

### **2. Build the base**

4. Meanwhile, heat a large sauce pot over medium-high heat with a generous amount of olive oil.
5. Add the diced **onions**, **carrots**, and **celery**, season with salt, and cook for 10–15 minutes, allowing them to brown rather than just soften<sup>Note 2</sup>.
6. Add the  **garlic**, **oregano**, **thyme**, **ground coriander**, and **smoked paprika**. Stir for 60–90 seconds until fragrant.
7. Add the **tomato paste**, cook for 1 minute to caramelise it slightly.
	- (Optional) you can add 1 teaspoon of harissa paste for some additional heat and depth.  
8. Pour in the **tinned tomatoes** and stir to combine, add more salt.
9. Add the **stock**, bring to a gentle simmer<sup>Note 3</sup>.

### **3. Lentil time**

10. Once the pot is simmering, add the **lentils** and **tinned beans**.
11. Add **MSG** if using.
12. Reduce to low heat and cook for 35–45 minutes, stirring occasionally<sup>Note 4</sup>.
13. Add more water or stock if the stew thickens too quickly and season throughout, tasting regularly.

### **4. It all comes together**

14. Fold the **roasted aubergine and courgette** into the pot.
15. Cook for another 5–10 minutes to meld flavours.
16. Add **red wine vinegar** or **lemon juice** to brighten the dish<sup>Note 5</sup>.
17. Adjust seasoning one final time.

### **5. Service please**

18. Serve in large, deep bowls.
19. Finish with fresh **basil** or **parsley**, **toasted seeds**, or a drizzle of **extra virgin olive oil** for contrast.

## Notes

>*Note 1:* Or roast in the oven at 180 on a baking tray, obviously this will take more time.

>*Note 2:* Browning on the bottom of the pan is fine. Just make sure you're moving the mirepoix around frequently to redistribute the moisture.

>*Note 3*: Lentils cook better if the pot is already at a simmering temperature.

>*Note 4:* Lentils can vary; cook to tenderness rather than time. Add extra water if needed.

>*Note 5:* Use the acid component sparingly; the goal is brightness, not acidity.
