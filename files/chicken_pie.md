(5.0⭐️)

This pie bangs. Take measurements as you wish, this is one of those dishes where you just eyeball everything and taste. Works amazing to go as a gravy and veg dinner, but surprisingly also works well just using the filling with some penne pasta or rice.

### **Pie filling**

## Notes

> Ingredients: Dried green herbs: Try some dried tarragon, or oregano, or mixed Italian seasoning. Just make sure to use sparingly as it can easily overpower the dish.

> Ingredients: Umami-based sauce: Try a tablespoon or two of some Worcester sauce, or Maggie's seasoning, or mushroom ketchup etc. Just make sure to taste as you add.
