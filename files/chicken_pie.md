(5.0⭐️)

This pie bangs. Take measurements as you wish, this is one of those dishes where you just eyeball everything and taste. Works amazing to go as a gravy and veg dinner, but surprisingly also works well just using the filling with some penne pasta or rice.

## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Chop the **chicken thigh** into chunks.

2. Dice the **brown onion**, **leeks**, and **garlic** and place together in a prep bowl.

3. Preheat a fan oven to 180°C.

### **Pie filling**

4. Heat the **olive oil** in a large steel pot and cook the **chicken thigh** chunks on a medium-high heat until browned.

5. Once browned, remove the **chicken thigh** from the pot and set aside. Add in the **pancetta** and fry until crispy.

6. Once crispy, deglaze the pot with a splash of water and add the diced **brown onion**, **leeks**, and **garlic**. Sweat the veg on a medium-low heat, making sure the veg doesn't catch and burn.

7. Once soft, add in the **red wine vinegar** and cook off for a few minutes.

8. Add the **chicken thigh** back into the pot and stir in the **dried green herbs**. Then stir in the **plain flour** a spoon at a time until everything is evenly coated and absorbed.

9. Pour in the **milk** a splash at a time, continually mixing until you have a thick pie filling.

10. Filling-wise, finally season with salt, pepper, and a few generous dashes of the **umami-based sauce** to taste.

### **Pie Baking**

11. Fill a pie dish with the filling. Lay the **puff pastry** on top. Trim sides and brush on the **egg yolk** wash. Sprinkle the top with some salt and place in the oven for **30 minutes** or until the pastry is puffed up and golden.

### **Service**

12. Serve up with some veggies and gravy.

## Notes

> Ingredients: Dried green herbs: Try some dried tarragon, or oregano, or mixed Italian seasoning. Just make sure to use sparingly as it can easily overpower the dish.

> Ingredients: Umami-based sauce: Try a tablespoon or two of some Worcester sauce, or Maggie's seasoning, or mushroom ketchup etc. Just make sure to taste as you add.
