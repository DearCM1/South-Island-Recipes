(4.0⭐️)

An easy weeknight dinner which is a certified 🥵flavour bomb🥵. This recipe is mainly for the squash itself and could be interchanged with whatever carb/salad/protein you wish–we like it with soy sauce rice and peas and some gochujang fried prawns.

We know, we know, the keen reader will already be saying, "umm, actually, the above image asset has slices of butternut squash instead of cubed, as per the recipe–pray tell, why there is a discrepancy?", to which we respond "brush my nuts."
