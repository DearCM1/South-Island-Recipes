## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Preheat oven to **180°C (fan)**.

2. Slice the **aubergines** lengthways into strips and layer them on a tray. Sprinkle each layer with salt and leave for **15–20 minutes** to draw out excess water.

### **Roasting the Aubergines**

3. After resting, dust each slice of **aubergine** in a bowl of **plain flour**.

4. Place slices on a baking tray in a single layer (do not stack). Season with **salt**, **pepper**, and a drizzle of **olive oil**.

5. Roast in the oven for **~20 minutes**, until slightly browned.

### **Tomato Sauce**

6. While the **aubergines** bake, dice the **red onions** and sauté in a pan with **olive oil** until softened and translucent.

7. Add chopped **parsley** (reserve some for garnish), the **capers**, **chopped olives**, and **red wine vinegar**. Cook until the vinegar evaporates.

8. Add the **tinned tomatoes** and simmer for **~10 minutes** until thickened.
    - To thicken further, stir in a little **flour** if needed.
    
9. Season with **salt, pepper, sugar** (Note 1), and extra parsley to taste.

### **Assembling the Bake**

10. In an oven dish, layer as follows:
    - Base layer of **aubergine slices**.
    - Spread of **tomato sauce**.
    - Another layer of **aubergine**.
    - **Sliced mozzarella**.
    - Repeat layers until ingredients are used, finishing with **aubergine**, then **mozzarella** on top.

11. Sprinkle generously with **grated parmesan**, drizzle with a little **olive oil**, and season lightly with **salt & pepper**.

12. Bake for **~30 minutes**, or until the cheese topping is golden and bubbling.

### **Service**

13. Allow to rest for **10 minutes** before serving (Note 2).

## Notes

> Note 1: There is generally a bitter taste to the sauce before finishing. Adding one to two teaspoons of sugar balances the acridity and pairs nicely with the **red wine vinegar** to make it extra juicy. 

> Note 2: Resting the dish before serving helps it set, making cleaner portions when cut. 

> Serve with white fish and a simple green salad for a balanced meal.
