## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Dice the **onions**, **celery**, **carrots**, and mince the **garlic**. Place aside in a large bowl.  
2. Dice the **chicken** into bite-sized pieces. In a separate bowl, coat with 1 tbsp of the **flour** until evenly covered.

### **Cooking**

3. Heat the **butter** and **olive oil** in a large pot on medium-high heat until melted and sizzling.  
4. Add the **chicken** and allow to brown undisturbed. Once it releases from the pan, flip to brown the other side. Remove the chicken to a clean bowl (do not fully cook yet).  
5. Reduce the pot to a medium heat and add the prepared **vegetables** with a pinch of salt. Let their water release and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits.  
6. Once the vegetables soften, sprinkle in the remaining **flour** and stir until coated. The bottom will start to get sticky again.  
7. Return the browned **chicken** to the pot, then add all the dried **herbs** and **chicken stock**. Stir well, deglazing the bottom again.  
8. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer for ~30 minutes, adding water if too thick.  
9. Season with **salt**, **pepper**, **red wine vinegar** (to taste), and **Worcestershire sauce**.  

### **Service**

10. Remove from heat. Stir in the **fresh parsley** and **grated parmesan**, letting the residual heat meld everything together.  
11. Serve hot with bread, mashed potato, or as a standalone stew.  

## Notes

> Chicken thighs will provide deeper flavour, but breasts keep it lighter.
> 
> Adjust thickness with extra stock or water depending on preference.
> 
> Parmesan adds richness. Taste as you go to balance saltiness.
